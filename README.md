# Automagic Colour Palette

This is a component for a future app that automatically generates a colour palette based on the input it is given. The envisioned use case is automated colour personalization of a user's GUI based on their implemented brand identity.

Check out the [demo here](https://ajgeel.github.io/automagic-colour-palette/vibrant-test.html).


## Controls

You can control the app using your keyboard: 
* Press `R` to refresh the page, and load a new image
* Press `1` for the `Vibrant` colour
* Press `2` for the `Muted` colour
* Press `3` for the `DarkVibrant` colour
* Press `4` for the `DarkMuted` colour
* Press `5` for the `LightVibrant` colour
